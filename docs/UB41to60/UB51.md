# UB51

Author: PeiHong Dai

## Definition

- **An object is assigned to an inexactly overlapping object or to an exactly overlapping object with incompatible type (6.5.16.1).**
- *将对象分配至与之不完全重叠或完全重叠的对象，且两者类型不兼容*


## Description

- If the value being stored in an object is read from another object that overlaps in any way the storage of the first object, then **the overlap shall exactly match and the two objects shall have qualified or unqualified versions of a compatible type**; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. (P91)

## Code

=== "`UB51.c`"

```C
#include  <stdio.h>
long long longInt = 0x00007fffffffffff;
int main(void)
{
    char *src = ((char *) &longInt) + 5;
    printf("long:\t%lld\nchar:\t%d\n", longInt, *src);
}
```

## Configurations

=== "`gcc 7.4.0`"

```
OS: Microsoft Windows 11 22H2

gcc -v : gcc version 7.4.0, x86_64-w64-mingw32

compile and run commands: gcc -o UB51.exe UB51.c && ./UB51.exe
```

=== "`clang 6.0.0`"

```
OS: Microsoft Windows 11 22H2

clang -v : clang version 6.0.0, x86_64-w64-mingw32

compile and run commands: clang -o UB51.exe UB51.c && ./UB51.exe
```

## Behaviors

=== "`gcc 7.4.0`"

```
compilation successful
output:
long:	140737488355327
char:	127
```

=== "`clang 6.0.0`"

```
compilation successful
output:
long:	140737488355327
char:	127
```


## Advice

- Although no difference is spotted in this example, long long integer could be arranged at inverted ends, then a difference could appear.
- To avoid this UB, programmers should **avoid referencing part of an object memory** if the arrangement is not explicitly and rigorously defined.
