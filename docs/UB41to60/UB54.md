# Ub54

Author: Kai Xu

##  Definition

**An arithmetic constant expression does not have arithmetic type; has operands that are not integer constants, floating constants, enumeration constants, character constants, predefined constants, sizeof expressions whose results are integer constants, or alignof expressions; or contains casts (outside operands to sizeof or alignof operators) other than conversions of arithmetic types to arithmetic types (6.6).**

## Description

原文：An *arithmetic constant expression* shall have arithmetic type and shall only have operands that are integer constants, floating constants, named or compound literal constants of arithmetic type, character constants, **sizeof** expressions whose results are integer constants, and **alignof** expressions. Cast operators in an arithmetic constant expression shall only convert arithmetic types to arithmetic types, except as part of an operand to the typeof operators, **sizeof** operator, or **alignof** operator(6.6.10)

**arithmetic types**: Integer and floating types are collectively called **arithmetic types**(6.2.3.23)



Similar in meaning to UB52, but expanding in scope.

与UB52意义相似，只是扩大了适用范围。

## Code

```c title="UB54.c"
int main() {
    int *p;
    1 + p + 1.5 + sizeof p;
    return 0;
}
```

## Configurations

=== "gcc 8.1.0"

    OS: Microsoft Windows 10 22H2
    
    gcc -v: gcc version 8.1.0 x86_64-w64-mingw32
    
    compile and run commands: gcc -o UB54.exe UB54.c && UB54.exe

=== "clang 13.0.0"

    OS: arm64-apple-darwin20.6.0
    
    clang -v: Apple clang version 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)
    
    compile and run commands: clang -o UB54.out UB54.c && ./UB54.out

## Behaviors

=== "gcc 8.1.0"

    error: invalid operands to binary + (have 'int *' and 'double')
         1 + p + 1.5 + sizeof p;

=== "clang 13.0.0"

    error: invalid operands to binary expression ('int *' and 'double')
        1 + p + 1.5 + sizeof p;

## Advice

正常变成中没有必要进行UB54的操作。
