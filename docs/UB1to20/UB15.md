# UB15

Author: PeiHong Dai

## Definition

- **A program requires the formation of a composite type from a variable length array type whose size is specified by an expression that is not evaluated (6.2.7).**
- *程序需要从变长数组类型形成复合类型，而该数组长度由未求值的表达式指定*

## Description

- A *composite type* can be constructed from two types that are compatible; it is a type that is compatible with both of the two types and satisfies conditions in 6.2.7.  Specifically, the undefined situation is clarified below:
  - If both types are array types, the following rules are applied:
    - If one type is an array of known constant size, the composite type is an array of that size.
    - **Otherwise, if one type is a variable length array whose size is specified by an expression that is not evaluated, the behavior is undefined.**

## Code

=== "`UB15.c`"

```c
#include  <stdio.h>
int m;
int main(void)
{
    char arr[m];
    m = 3;
    printf("%d\n", sizeof(arr));
    return 0;
}
```

## Configurations

=== "`gcc 7.4.0`"

```
OS: Microsoft Windows 11 22H2

gcc -v : gcc version 7.4.0, x86_64-w64-mingw32

compile and run commands: gcc -o UB15.exe UB15.c && ./UB15.exe
```

=== "`clang 6.0.0`"

```
OS: Microsoft Windows 11 22H2

clang -v : clang version 6.0.0, x86_64-w64-mingw32

compile and run commands: clang -o UB15.exe UB15.c && ./UB15.exe
```

## Behaviors

=== "`gcc 7.4.0`"

```
compilation successful
output:
0
```

=== "`clang 6.0.0`"

```
compilation successful
output:
0
```

## Advice

- VLAs in C99 and forth are dependent on other variables, if user interactions are involved during the process, the compiler cannot determine the size during compilation, which could cause UBs.

- ```c
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int str[n];
    ```

- For better stability and robustness, just try the old-school approach: malloc

- ```c
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int* str = malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    ...
    free(str);
    ```

- By the way, the *sizeof evaluation of VLA* is problematic since its implementation is during compilation, our teacher is working on this matter now.
