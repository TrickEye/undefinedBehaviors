# UB15

Author: PeiHong Dai

## Definition

- **A program requires the formation of a composite type from a variable length array type whose size is specified by an expression that is not evaluated (6.2.7).**
- 程序需要从变长数组类型形成复合类型，而该数组长度由未求值的表达式指定*

## Description

- A *composite type* can be constructed from two types that are compatible; it is a type that is compatible with both of the two types and satisfies conditions in 6.2.7.  Specifically, the undefined situation is clarified below:
  - If both types are array types, the following rules are applied:
    - If one type is an array of known constant size, the composite type is an array of that size.
    - **Otherwise, if one type is a variable length array whose size is specified by an expression that is not evaluated, the behavior is undefined.**

## Code

- UB15.c

- ***no proper example has been chosen yet.***

## Configurations

- gcc 7.4.0

```
OS: Microsoft Windows 11 22H2

gcc -v : gcc version 7.4.0, x86_64-w64-mingw32

compile and run commands: gcc -o UB15.exe UB15.c && ./UB15.exe
```

- clang 6.0.0

```
OS: Microsoft Windows 11 22H2

clang -v : clang version 6.0.0, x86_64-w64-mingw32

compile and run commands: clang -o UB15.exe UB15.c && ./UB15.exe
```

## Behaviors

- gcc 7.4.0

- clang 6.0.0

## Advice

- VLAs in C99 and forth are dependent on other variables, if user interactions are involved during the process, the compiler cannot determine the size during compilation, which could cause UBs.

- ```c
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int str[n];
    ```

- For better stability and robustness, just try the old-school approach: malloc

- ```c
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int* str = malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    ...
    free(str);
    ```
