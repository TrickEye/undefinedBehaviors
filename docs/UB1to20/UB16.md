# UB16

Author: PeiHong Dai

## Definition

- **Conversion to or from an integer type produces a value outside the range that can be represented (6.3.1.4).**
- 转换为整数类型或从整数类型转换产生超出可表示范围的值*

## Description

- 6.3.1.4 is about details of conversions between integer types and real floating types. Specifically, the two undefined situations are emphasized below:

  - When a finite value of standard floating type is converted to an integer type other than **bool**, the fractional part is discarded. **If the value of the integral part cannot be represented by the integer type, the behavior is undefined.**
  - When a value of integer type is converted to a standard floating type, **If the value being converted is outside the range of values that can be represented, the behavior is undefined.**

## Code

- `UB16.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    double bigFloat = 9223372036854775807.0;
    int ovInt = bigFloat;
    printf("%d\n", ovInt);
}
```

## Configurations

- gcc 7.4.0

```
OS: Microsoft Windows 11 22H2

gcc -v : gcc version 7.4.0, x86_64-w64-mingw32

compile and run commands: gcc -o UB16.exe UB16.c && ./UB16.exe
```

- clang 6.0.0

```
OS: Microsoft Windows 11 22H2

clang -v : clang version 6.0.0, x86_64-w64-mingw32

compile and run commands: clang -o UB16.exe UB16.c && ./UB16.exe
```

## Behaviors

- gcc 7.4.0

```
compilation successful
output:
2147483647
```

- clang 6.0.0

```
compilation successful
output:
-240260744 (random numbers)
```

## Advice

- This UB suggest that programmers should not risk to exert implicit type conversion on most types.
- Better still, **predefining** a set of types that have **strict boundaries** and **avoid conversions** to the most extent could help.
